          <p class="lead" title="I love being Jamaican">
            Hello my name is Junior Ramsey Jr.
            I know what you're thinking! Wait you're a Jr jr? <br>Yes i am and so my family just calls me JJ.
            Born on Feb 18, 1989 in an area called PG County, Maryland although my family originated from Jamaica.<br>To
            all my Jamaicans reading this Wah Gwan! For my 30th birthday i jumped out of a plane at 15k feet in the air
            and
            it was the greatest thrill ever.
            <br>I am the 5th child of nine,the outgoing middle child.
            I have 5 sisters and 3 brothers. <br>I moved to Florida a year ago in order to pursue a job at NASA as a
            System
            Admin.
            <br>So far my time here has been great. The weather is wonderful and most of all NO STATE INCOME TAX!!!! I
            am a
            father of two amazing children. I have a son named Ahmad, a daughter name Adore and a beautiful girlfriend
            name
            Brianna.<br>
            <br>After much thought I decided to take this course to take this course in order to my talents to the next
            level. 10 years ago i would have never thought to be in the IT field but ever since i made to career switch
            my
            life has changed for the best and im never looking back!!<br></p>
